A recent advisory from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) suggested the tenth test flight could have happened as soon as June 29. \nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in a post seemingly related to the explosion that he considers it to be: \u201cJust a scratch.\u201d\nANOMALY!

Intel announced a new chief revenue officer in addition to multiple high-profile engineering hires.\nJune 17 \u2013 Intel will begin to lay off a significant chunk of its Intel Foundry staff in July. The company plans to eliminate at least 15%, and up to 20%, of workers in that business unit. These layoffs aren\u2019t a shock: It was rumored back in April, and Intel\u2019s CEO Lip-Bu Tan has said he wants to flatten the organization.\nJune 13 \u2013 Nvidia isn\u2019t counting on the U.S. backing off of its AI chip export restrictions anytime soon. After the company took a financial hit from the newly imposed licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company will no longer include the Chinese market in future revenue and profit forecasts.\nJune 6 \u2013 AMD makes another acquisition \u2014\u00a0this time focused on talent. The company acqui-hired the team behind Untether AI, which develops AI inference chips, as the semiconductor giant continues to round out its AI offerings.\nJune 4 \u2013 AMD continued its shopping spree. The company acquired AI software optimization startup Brium, which helps companies retrofit AI software to work with different AI hardware. With a lot of AI software being designed with Nvidia hardware in mind, this acquisition isn\u2019t surprising.\nMay 28 \u2013 Nvidia reported that U.S. licensing requirements on its H20 AI chips cost the company $4.5 billion in charges during Q1. The company expects these requirements to result in an $8 billion hit to Nvidia\u2019s revenue in Q2.\nMay 28 \u2013 AMD kicks off its acquisition spree. The semiconductor company announced that it acquired Enosemi, a silicon photonics startup. Enosemi\u2019s tech, which uses light photons to transmit data, is becoming an increasing area of interest for semiconductor companies.\nMay 21 \u2013 China\u2019s Commerce Secretary didn\u2019t like the U.S.\u2019s guidance, issued on May 13, that warned U.S. companies that using Huawei\u2019s AI chips \u201canywhere in the world\u201d was a U.S. chip export violation. The commerce secretary issued a statement that threatened legal action against anyone caught enforcing that export restriction.\nMay 20 \u2013 Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan seemingly got right to work on his plan to spin out Intel\u2019s non-core business units. The semiconductor giant is reportedly looking to offload its networking and edge units, which makes chips for telecom equipment, and was responsible for $5.4 billion of the company\u2019s 2024 revenue.\nMay 13 \u2013 Just days before the Biden administration\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule was set to go into place, the U.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded it. The DOC said that it plans to issue new guidance in the future, and in the meantime companies should remember that using Huawei\u2019s Ascend AI chips anywhere in the world is a violation of U.S. export rules.\nMay 7: Just a week before the \u201cFramework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion\u201d was set to go into place, the Trump administration plans on taking a different path. According to multiple media outlets, including Axios and Bloomberg, the administration won\u2019t enforce the restrictions when they were supposed to start on May 15 and is instead working on its own framework.\u00a0\nApril 30:\u00a0Anthropic doubled down on its support for restricting U.S.-made chip exports, including some tweaks to the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, like imposing further restrictions on Tier 2 countries and dedicating resources to enforcement.\u00a0An Nvidia spokesperson shot back, saying, \u201cAmerican firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in \u2018baby bumps\u2019 or \u2018alongside live lobsters.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\nApril 22:\u00a0Ahead of its Q1 earnings call, Intel said it was planning to lay off more than 21,000 employees. The layoffs were meant to streamline management, something CEO Lip-Bu Tan has long said Intel needed to do, and help rebuild the company\u2019s engineering focus.\u00a0\nApril 15:\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s H20 AI chip got hit with an export licensing requirement, the company disclosed in an SEC filing. The company added it expects $5.5 billion in charges related to this new requirement in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can still export to China in some form or fashion. TSMC and Intel reported similar expenses the same week.\u00a0\nApril 9:\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang was spotted attending dinner at Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort, according to reports. At the time, NPR reported Huang may have been able to spare Nvidia\u2019s H20 AI chips from export restrictions upon agreeing to invest in AI data centers in the U.S.\u00a0\nApril 3:\u00a0Intel and TSMC allegedly reached a tentative agreement to launch a joint chipmaking venture. This joint venture would operate Intel\u2019s chipmaking facilities, and TSMC would have a 20% stake in the new venture. Both companies declined to comment or confirm. If this deal doesn\u2019t come to fruition, this is likely a decent preview of potential deals in this industry to come.\u00a0\nApril 1:\u00a0CEO Lip-Bu Tan got to work right away. Just weeks after he joined Intel, the company announced that it was going to spin off noncore assets so it could focus. He also said the company would launch new products, including custom semiconductors for customers.\u00a0\nMarch 12:\u00a0 Intel announced that industry veteran, and former board member, Lip-Bu Tan would return to the company as CEO on March 18. At the time of his appointment, Tan said Intel would be an \u201cengineering-focused company\u201d under his leadership.\u00a0\nFebruary 28:\u00a0Intel was supposed to start operating its first chip fabrication plant in Ohio this year. Instead, the company slowed down construction on the plant for the second time in February. Now the $28 billion semiconductor project won\u2019t wrap up construction until 2030 and may not even open until 2031.\nFebruary 3:\u00a0U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo), wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Nominee-Designate Howard Lutnick urging the Trump administration to further restrict AI chip exports. The letter specifically referred to Nvidia\u2019s H20 AI chips, which were used in the training of DeepSeek\u2019s R1 \u201creasoning\u201d model.\u00a0\nJanuary 27:\u00a0Chinese AI startup DeepSeek caused quite the stir in Silicon Valley when it released the open version of its R1 \u201creasoning\u201d model. While this isn\u2019t semiconductor news specifically, the sheer alarm in the AI and semiconductor industries DeepSeek\u2019s release caused continues to have ripple effects on the chip industry.\u00a0\nJanuary 13:\u00a0With just a week left in office, former president Joe Biden proposed sweeping new export restrictions on U.S.-made AI chips. This order created a three-tier structure that determined how many U.S. chips can be exported to each country. Under this proposal, Tier 1 countries faced no restrictions; Tier 2 countries had a chip purchase limit for the first time; and Tier 3 countries got additional restrictions.\u00a0\nJanuary 6:\u00a0Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei co-wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal endorsing existing AI chip export controls and pointing to them as a reason why China\u2019s AI market was behind the U.S.\u2019. He also called on incoming president Donald Trump to impose further restrictions and to close loopholes that have allowed AI companies in China to still get their hands on these chips.\nTopics\n\nSenior Reporter, Venture\n\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond\u2014founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago \u2014 and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared.\u00a0\nDuring that period, the world\u2019s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups.\nThe chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It\u2019s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.)\u00a0\nIn 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds.\nNvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be \u201cgame changers and market makers.\u201d\u00a0\nBelow is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round.\nOpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker\u2019s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI\u2019s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion.\nxAI:\u00a0 Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk\u2019s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI\u2019s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI\u2019s cap table a few months later.\nInflection:\u00a0 One of Nvidia\u2019s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection\u2019s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI\u2019s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future.\nWayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area.\nScale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion.\nCrusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia.\nFigure AI: In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion.\nMistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June.\u00a0\u00a0\nLambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda\u2019s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia\u2019s GPUs.\nCohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere\u2019s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023.\nPerplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data.\nPoolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures.

So he negotiated for stock to make up the difference. Eighteen months later, Stripe acquired the company, and that equity converted into Stripe shares, enough to let Kinvi leave his job, bootstrap a side project, and eventually found a startup.\nThat startup, Borderless, is now helping Africans in the diaspora collectively invest in startups and real estate back home. Since launching in beta last year, the U.K.-based platform has processed over $500,000 in transactions. \n\u201cThe diaspora sends billions of dollars in remittances, but very little of it goes into productive assets,\u201d Kinvi said. \u201cWe think that there is a world where, if we can bring the right collective to the right type of investment opportunities, it\u2019ll make it a lot easier for them.\u201d\nKinvi\u2019s journey to Borderless began in 2020, just as the pandemic hit. He and a group of friends formed Hoaq, an investment club that pooled small checks from local and diasporan angels into African startups.\nTheir first challenge was simply opening a bank account. Financial institutions flagged their activity, and their account with Wise was repeatedly frozen. Other hurdles soon followed: currency mismatches, regulatory requirements, and accreditation rules that made collective investing a legal and logistical headache.\nTo manage the complexity, the group used membership dues to hire a lawyer to handle the paperwork manually. Eventually, Hoaq built light automation into its workflow, an experience that laid the foundation for Borderless. Hoaq has invested in companies such as LemFi, Bamboo and Chowdeck.\nBy 2022, Kinvi had left Stripe, where he had transitioned into a product and growth role and later spent a year at Paystack, another Stripe subsidiary, helping scale financial partnerships across Africa.\u00a0\nWhen he returned to the problem that had formed Hoaq, he built a tool that digitized everything from onboarding to disbursement. What began as an internal solution soon gained outside interest. Other collectives wanted access, not just for startup deals but for real estate and other assets.\nToday, Borderless provides the backend infrastructure for diaspora collectives, allowing them to onboard members, accept cross-border payments, and deploy capital securely.\u00a0\nThere are over 100 communities on its waitlist, according to the startup. However, over the past couple of months, the collectives currently live on the platform have backed more than 10 startups and two real estate projects in Kenya, with minimum investments of $1,000 for startups and $5,000 for property.\u00a0\nBorderless operates under U.K. regulatory cover, permitting it to market investment opportunities to diaspora members without violating securities laws. \nFor now, it focuses on two asset classes, startups and real estate, but Kinvi sees room to expand into others, including film and diaspora bonds.\nIn establishing that the most important part of the Borderless model is trust, Kinvi is blunt about why many diaspora investors hesitate to deploy capital: too many have lost money trying to invest informally through family or friends. \n\u201cSomeone I know sent \u20ac200,000 home to build a house,\u201d he said. \u201cThe house was never built.\u201d\nTo address this, Borderless routes investor funds directly to verified sellers, escrow accounts, or lawyers. No money flows through the hands of collective managers. Legal and compliance checks are embedded into the process, and all opportunities require approval under the platform\u2019s regulatory umbrella.\nBorderless earns revenue through transaction fees as well as a cut of membership dues and FX spreads. Over time, it may layer on remittance products, payout fees, and asset management tools.\u00a0\nThe bigger opportunity, Kinvi argues, lies in unlocking the $30 billion in migrant savings that sit idle every year. While remittance platforms like Zepz, Taptap Send, LemFi and NALA dominate the space of taking some of that money back home, few have built for long-term investing (that might change in the coming years with recent moves from some players).\nThat message has resonated with local investors. Borderless\u2019s backers include DFS Lab, Ezra Olubi (Paystack CTO), Olumide Soyombo, and executives from Stripe, Google, among others. Many are not just investors, but also users of the platform.\nFor Kinvi, the mission for Borderless, which raised $500,000 in seed from these investors, is as much about identity as returns. \u201cMost Africans in the diaspora want to go back home someday,\u201d he said. \u201cTo do that, they need a way to invest securely and confidently at scale. That\u2019s what we\u2019re building.\u201d\nStill, scaling won\u2019t be easy. Borderless\u2019 current vetting model relies heavily on pre-existing relationships and known collective heads. As it grows, it will need robust identity verification, fraud detection, and legal tooling to avoid becoming a target for bad actors.\nTopics\n\nReporter, Africa\n\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond\u2014founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

Another notes that lossless music is \u201cbest enjoyed on devices compatible with Spotify Connect and/or wired devices.\u201d\nIn addition, Reddit user u/bendotlc noted that other changes were seen in the latest version of the mobile app, where the code now mentions lossless: \u201cSay hello to the best sound quality on Spotify. Listen to high-fidelity music in up to 24-bit/44.1 kHz.\u201d The Redditor claims the feature is actually present in the app, but is currently disabled. (TechCrunch confirmed these claims with data provided by Appsensa, see below.) \nOf course, code references don\u2019t mean the lossless feature is coming anytime soon. \nAs we\u2019ve seen in previous years, leaks and code references have appeared before, and yet the high-quality audio tier never arrived.\nWhen asked directly about lossless and other plans for premium tiers on recent earnings calls with investors, Spotify execs, including CEO Daniel Ek, would only hint that the company was investing in premium products for \u201csuper fans.\u201d They wouldn\u2019t give a time frame on when these or any other higher-quality streaming options would finally launch.\nMost recently, Spotify Chief Business Officer Alex Norstrom told investors on the Q1 2025 call that Spotify was still investing in more premium tiers. \n\u201cNow, with regards to higher tiers, we see great potential in them as we\u2019ve mentioned before,\u201d he said. \u201cSo creating higher tiers around new offerings is something we are working towards as it really opens up new opportunities to delight users,\u201d Norstrom said at the time.\nWhen Spotify first announced its plans for Spotify HiFi, as it was then called, in 2021, it said that the service would offer users music in \u201cCD-quality, lossless audio format.\u201d It had run tests of a lossless option in the years before this, however.\nEventually, Spotify pointed to licensing issues as the reason for its delay in launching.  \nIn what could be promising news on that front, the streamer signed new deals with labels including Warner Music and Universal Music Group in early 2025, which could pave the way for the lossless tier \u2014 or so music fans hope.\nBloomberg also reported earlier this year that a premium Music Pro tier would launch later in 2025, which would include high-quality streaming, remixing, and other features.\nSpotify declined to comment on this report. \nUpdated after publication with additional data from Spotify\u2019s mobile app. \n\nTopics\n\nConsumer News Editor\n\nSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Altman, who describes himself as \u201cextremely kid-pilled,\u201d said he was \u201cconstantly\u201d using ChatGPT to ask questions about the behavior of babies during the first few weeks of his son\u2019s life \u2014 now that he\u2019s a bit more settled, he\u2019s using ChatGPT to ask more general questions about children\u2019s developmental stages.\n\u201cI mean, clearly, people have been able to take care of babies without ChatGPT for a long time,\u201d Altman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I would\u2019ve done that.\u201d\nThis, obviously, isn\u2019t fundamentally different from frantically Googling questions about babies, something that even the most well-prepared parents have been doing for decades. But, given who Altman is, his choice of internet tool to use is no surprise.\nStill, when hallucination remains a challenge for AI products, it may be concerning to imagine relying so heavily on a chat AI for baby-care answers.\nBut parents have been known to turn to many a questionable source for information in the middle of the night. My colleagues with children describe the \u201cbottomless pit\u201d of Google, and the minefield of parenting Facebook groups. Is ChatGPT really much different than taking the advice of someone online who\u2019s insisting that you are a neglectful caretaker if you aren\u2019t basing your baby\u2019s bed time on the current phase of the moon?\nPerhaps the idea of parents using AI in search for child-raising answers is less of a \u201cprimal alarm bell\u201d than the idea of very young children using it, which Altman also discussed.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this video that always has stuck with me of a baby, or a little toddler, with one of those old glossy magazines [tapping] the [cover],\u201d Altman said. The child thought that the magazine was an iPad. \u201cKids born now will just think that the world always had extremely smart AI.\u201d\nFormer OpenAI science communicator Andrew Mayne, who was interviewing Altman, recalled seeing a social media post from a parent who used the voice mode of ChatGPT to talk to his child about his obsessions.\n\u201cHe got tired of talking to his kid about Thomas the Tank Engine, so he put ChatGPT into voice mode\u2026 An hour later, the kid\u2019s still talking about Thomas the train,\u201d Mayne said gleefully.\n\u201cKids love voice mode,\u201d Altman interjected.\nAs today\u2019s parents turn to ChatGPT for all sorts of similar uses, this will likely end up reflecting the same repetitive discourse around the \u201ciPad kid\u201d generation (yes, it\u2019s probably bad to let your kid watch hours and hours of \u201cCocomelon\u201d; no, it\u2019s not fair to expect parents to occupy their kids\u2019 time 24/7).\nBut existing children\u2019s media is at least, for now, created by a team of humans, while ChatGPT\u2019s own policies recommend it not be used by children under age 13. It does not have a vetted parental controls mode. Even Altman is aware of the risks, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all going to be good. There will be problems,\u201d Altman said. \u201cPeople will develop these somewhat problematic, or maybe very problematic parasocial relationships, and society will have to figure out new guardrails.\u201d\nAltman is correct. We do not fully know the effect of letting kids talk to a large language model about Thomas the Tank Engine for an hour. But at the end of the day, Altman is the head of a massive company spending billions and billions of dollars with the hope of building AI that is smarter than humans, and he never forgets that in his messaging.\n\u201cThe upsides will be tremendous!\u201d Altman said. \u201cSociety in general is good at figuring how to mitigate the downsides.\u201d\nTopics\n\nSenior Writer\n\nAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

And the deal was cash, Wix confirmed to TechCrunch.\u00a0\nAdmittedly, this wasn\u2019t a billion dollars or close to it. And Shlomo wasn\u2019t truly solo \u2014 he had eight employees, Wix confirmed. They will collectively receive $25 million of the $80 million as a \u201cretention\u201d bonus. Wix declined to give details on that part of the deal, like how long they have to stay in their jobs to get full payouts.\nStill, Base44\u2019s rapid rise and impressive sale price have been the talk of the vibe-coding community.\u00a0\nIn its six months as a stand-alone company, Base44 reportedly grew to 250,000 users, hitting 10,000 users within its first three weeks. According to Shlomo\u2019s posts on X and LinkedIn, the company was profitable, generating $189,000 in profit in May even after covering high LLM token costs, which he also documented publicly.\nBase44 spread mostly through word of mouth as Shlomo, a 31-year-old programmer, shared his building journey on LinkedIn and Twitter. The project began as a side venture, he told Israeli tech news site CTech.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cBase44 is a moonshot experiment \u2014 helping everyone, technical or not, build software without coding at all,\u201d he explained on LinkedIn when he launched it to the public.\nIt\u2019s one of the newer crop of vibe-coding products designed for non-programmers. Users enter text prompts, and the platform builds complete applications, with database, storage, authentication, analytics, and integration. It also supports email, texting, and maps, with a roadmap for more enterprise-grade security support.\nBase44 isn\u2019t unique in this area. Other vibe coders like Adaptive Computer handle similar infrastructure work. But Base44\u2019s fast rise was astounding all the same.\nShlomo was already known in the Israeli startup community through his previous startup, the Insight Partners-backed data analytics company Explorium. His brother is also a co-founder of an AI security startup, Token Security, which just raised $20 million led by Notable Capital (formerly GGV Capital) and a bunch of Israeli tech angels.\nHe quickly gained partnership agreements  for Base44 with big Israeli tech companies like eToro and Similarweb.\nAfter posting about his decision to use Anthropic\u2019s Claude LLM through AWS instead of models by OpenAI \u2014 mostly for cost-per-performance reasons \u2014 Amazon invited Base44 to demo at a Tel Aviv AWS event last month, which Shlomo documented.\n\u201cCrazy f***ing journey so far,\u201d Shlomo posted on LinkedIn when announcing the news of the acquisition. Despite the growth and the profits \u2014 or really because of it \u2014 he sold his still-bootstrapped company because \u201cthe scale and volume we need is not something we can organically grow into\u00a0\u2026 If we were able to get so far organically, bootstrapped, I\u2019m excited to see our new pace now that we have all the resources in place,\u201d he wrote.\nFor its part, Wix picked up a proven, fast-growing, local vibe-coding platform for a relative song because of its youth. OpenAI paid $3 billion for Windsurf, which was founded in 2021.\u00a0\nWix, of course, offers no-code website building that look professionally designed. Adding a profitable LLM vibe-coding product to its offerings is a logical move.\nShlomo could not be immediately reached for additional comment.\nTopics\n\nVenture Editor\n\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond\u2014founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

But soon after ChatGPT was released, it occurred to him that AI can change how professional service firms use technology.\n\u201cI realized I was barking up the wrong tree by trying to build a SaaS business, and instead I should figure out how to make these people more effective,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\nThe startup acquired Citrine International Tax, a boutique provider of cross-border tax accounting services, and enhanced the firm with AI capabilities built by Multiplier.\nIt quickly became apparent that the strategy was working. By eliminating manual work, Multiplier\u2019s AI tools helped Citrine more than double its profit margins. So, Pepper decided that instead of building software for accounting firms, Multiplier would acquire existing professional service businesses and outfit them with its AI solution.\nToday, Multiplier, which is now called Multiplier Holdings, is announcing that it raised a total of $27.5 million in seed and Series A financing. Lightspeed Venture Partners led the Series A funding round for the startup, following Multiplier\u2019s seed round, which was led by Ribbit Capital with participation from SV Angel.\nMultiplier is part of a growing trend: startups acquiring existing service businesses and scaling them with AI. The PE-style roll-up strategy has recently gained popularity among VCs, with investors such as General Catalyst, Elad Gil, Thrive, and Khosla Ventures backing startups that develop AI solutions and integrate them into existing people-focused companies.\n\u201cUntil AI existed, none of this was possible,\u201d Lightspeed partner Justin Overdorff said. In addition to Multiplier, Lightspeed has invested in three other yet-to-be-announced AI-powered roll-up companies.\nOverdorff is convinced that this strategy is most effective when the startup buys small companies because they are more open to changing their existing processes. \u201cIf you go to an accounting firm that has 200 accountants, it\u2019s unlikely to get adopted at a [high] rate.\u201d\nPrior to being purchased by Multiplier, Citrine was a 12-person tax accounting entity. Multiplier not only helped increase its margins but also helped Citrine grow, Overdorff said.\nMultiplier\u2019s\u00a0goal is to expand beyond offering personal tax compliance to create an AI-powered competitor to the Big Four accounting firms.\nPepper said that Multiplier is looking to purchase high-recurring-revenue service firms helmed by people who are excited to integrate and help customize AI to take their businesses to the next level.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like a venture-style business where you\u2019re looking to make a bet on this leader who you think is just amazing in their category,\u201d Pepper said.\n\nTopics\n\nReporter, Venture\n\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond\u2014founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

Much like Midjourney\u2019s image models, V1 is only available through Discord, and it\u2019s only available on the web at launch.\nIntroducing our V1 Video Model. It's fun, easy, and beautiful. Available at 10$/month, it's the first video model for *everyone* and it's available now. pic.twitter.com/iBm0KAN8uy\nThe launch of V1 puts Midjourney in competition with AI video generation models from other companies, such as OpenAI\u2019s Sora, Runway\u2019s Gen 4, Adobe\u2019s Firefly, and Google\u2019s Veo 3. While many companies are focused on developing controllable AI video models for use in commercial settings, Midjourney has always stood out for its distinctive AI image models that cater to creative types. \nThe company says it has larger goals for its AI video models than generating B-roll for Hollywood films or commercials for the ad industry. In a blog post, Midjourney CEO David Holz says its AI video model is the company\u2019s next step toward its ultimate destination, creating AI models \u201ccapable of real-time open-world simulations.\u201d\nAfter AI video models, Midjourney says it plans to develop AI models for producing 3D renderings, as well as real-time AI models.\nThe launch of Midjourney\u2019s V1 model comes just a week after the startup was sued by two of Hollywood\u2019s most notorious film studios: Disney and Universal. The suit alleges that images created by Midjourney\u2019s AI image models depict the studio\u2019s copyrighted characters, like Homer Simpson and Darth Vader.\nHollywood studios have struggled to confront the rising popularity of AI image and video-generating models, such as the ones Midjourney develops. There\u2019s a growing fear that these AI tools could replace or devalue the work of creatives in their respective fields, and several media companies have alleged that these products are trained on their copyrighted works.\nWhile Midjourney has tried to pitch itself as different from other AI image and video startups \u2014 more focused on creativity than immediate commercial applications \u2014 the startup cannot escape these accusations.\nTo start, Midjourney says it will charge 8x more for a video generation than a typical image generation, meaning subscribers will run out of their monthly allotted generations significantly faster when creating videos than images.\nAt launch, the cheapest way to try out V1 is by subscribing to Midjourney\u2019s $10-per-month Basic plan. Subscribers to Midjourney\u2019s $60-a-month Pro plan and $120-a-month Mega plan will have unlimited video generations in the company\u2019s slower, \u201cRelax\u201d mode. Over the next month, Midjourney says it will reassess its pricing for video models.\nmidjourney introduces video generation and it\u2019s surpassing all my expectations. pic.twitter.com/lWqakbSTVV\nV1 comes with a few custom settings that allow users to control the video model\u2019s outputs.\nUsers can select an automatic animation setting to make an image move randomly, or they can select a manual setting that allows users to describe, in text, a specific animation they want to add to their video. Users can also toggle the amount of camera and subject movement by selecting \u201clow motion\u201d or \u201chigh motion\u201d in settings.\nWhile the videos generated with V1 are only five seconds long, users can choose to extend them by four seconds up to four times, meaning that V1 videos could get as long as 21 seconds.\nMuch like Midjourney\u2019s AI image models, early demos of V1\u2019s videos look somewhat otherworldly, rather than hyperrealistic. The initial response to V1 has been positive, though it\u2019s still unclear how well it matches up against other leading AI video models, which have been on the market for months or even years.\nTopics\n\nSenior AI Reporter\n\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond\u2014founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

And on CEO Fredrik Hjelm\u2019s wishlist is Bolt, the European mobility super-app best known for ride-hailing.\nNot that Bolt\u2019s micromobility business is necessarily for sale \u2014 despite talk of Voi buying the company\u2019s scooter and bike arm. Bolt declined to comment when TechCrunch reached out.\u00a0\n\u201cBolt is a great company, but they are mainly a ride-hailing company,\u201d Hjelm told TechCrunch onstage at the Micromobility Industries roundtable in Brussels, where he was joined by Bird co-CEO Michael Washinushi and Dott/Tier CEO Henri Moissinac.\nHjelm said Bolt\u2019s challenge is that it needs to be \u201cextremely good in several verticals.\u201d Aside from ride-hailing, Bolt offers grocery and food delivery, as well as car rentals.\u00a0\n\u201cMicromobility is very difficult, and it has the hardware aspect, but no network effect like how food delivery and ride-hailing [can lead to] grocery delivery, as well,\u201d Hjelm said.\u00a0\nHe noted most people who pick up a dockless e-scooter or e-bike are locals who prioritize experience and affordability rather than the ability to use a \u201csuper app\u201d like Bolt.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen provided an example of riders who use micromobility services because they recognize the brand \u2014 and might not want to download another app \u2014 he stuck to this thesis. Hjelm said he doesn\u2019t think brand recognition is enough to make up for a worse user experience.\nOf course, there\u2019s no data proving that Voi offers a better user experience than Bolt. That didn\u2019t stop others on the panel from joining the Bolt pile-on.\n\u201cBolt uses price as a loss leader,\u201d said Bird\u2019s Washinushi, referring to Bolt\u2019s ability to rely on revenue from its other operations to grow its micromobility business at a loss. \u201cThey discount the price, and that\u2019s how they acquire installs. My sense is they don\u2019t make a huge investment in\u2026really good operations in micromobility.\u201d\nWashinushi noted that Bird, as well as Dott and Voi, use a lot of data to rebalance vehicles.\u00a0\n\u201cYou can dump thousands of vehicles and hope people get rides, or you can\u2026 place half those vehicles at the right place and right time to optimize the rides and optimize the price,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s [how] the business has really evolved in the past two or three years\u2026 that, for us, makes it a very self-sustaining business.\u201d\u00a0\nIn 2024, Bird said it achieved $19 million adjusted EBITDA profitability \u2014 quite the feat for a company that had delisted from the stock market and filed for bankruptcy two years ago. Voi also achieved its first profitable year last year with adjusted EBITDA of $17.9 million.\u00a0\nBolt hasn\u2019t shared financial numbers for its micromobility business. In November 2024, the company said it had hit $2.11 billion in annual revenue across its business units, but didn\u2019t share how much it lost. According to local reports, Bolt recorded revenue of around $2 billion in 2023 on an operating loss of $108 million.\nTechCrunch attempted to follow up Wednesday with Hjelm about why he\u2019d want to acquire Bolt and whether he has been in talks with the company. \n\u201cI\u2019m at the Swedish House Mafia reunion and will think about Bolt tomorrow,\u201d he responded. \nTechCrunch will update this story if Hjelm has more to say on the matter. \n\nTopics\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk\u2019s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

Now, it appears OpenAI has changed its tone.\nOpenAI said it was already winding down its work with Scale AI ahead of Meta\u2019s announcement last week that it was investing billions of dollars in the startup and bringing on CEO Alexandr Wang. An OpenAI spokesperson told Bloomberg that OpenAI had been seeking other providers for more specialized data to develop increasingly advanced AI models.\nOpenAI\u2019s decision to cut ties raises questions about Scale AI\u2019s core data labeling business. Last week, Reuters reported that Google was discussing plans to drop Scale AI as a data provider as well.\nAs rumors swirled about Meta\u2019s deal with Wang, some of Scale AI\u2019s competitors said they received an influx of interest from AI model providers looking for \u201cneutral\u201d partners.\nIn a blog post published Wednesday, Scale AI\u2019s general counsel tried to squash the idea that Meta would receive preferential treatment following this deal. Scale AI\u2019s executives said it would not share confidential information from other customers with Meta, and that Wang would not be involved in day-to-day operations.\nDespite those claims, it seems that Scale AI\u2019s biggest customers are already pivoting away from the data provider \u2014 meaning the startup may have no choice but to change up its business.\nIn a separate blog post published on Wednesday, Scale AI\u2019s interim CEO Jason Droege said the company would \u201cdouble down\u201d on its applications business, which involves building custom AI applications for governments and enterprises.\nTopics\n\nSenior AI Reporter\n\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond\u2014founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

It serves as a notice for intent to sue xAI for violations of the Clean Air Act. The law requires organizations to submit such a letter 60 days in advance of filing a lawsuit.\u00a0\nThe gas turbines have the potential to emit more than 2,000 tons of NOx per year, a group of chemicals that contribute to smog.\u00a0\nMemphis already \u201chad some of the worst air quality in the region,\u201d SELC notes. \u201cIn 2024, Memphis was deemed an asthma capital of the nation by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America due to high rates of emergency room visits and deaths from asthma.\u201d\nSELC alleges that xAI failed to obtain permits required by both the federal and local regulators before installing the generators. It also alleges that the company wasn\u2019t operating them with proper air pollution controls. At one point, xAI had enough turbines to generate 421 megawatts of electricity.\nLast summer, the Shelby County Health Department (SCHD), which oversees local air pollution compliance, \u201ctold reporters that xAI\u2019s turbines were exempt from permitting, although SCHD still had not disclosed publicly what xAI was operating on its site nor the legal basis for any such exemption,\u201d SELC said.\nTo determine what was happening at the Colossus site, SELC paid an aerial photographer to capture images of the facility in March. The photos revealed that xAI had installed 35 turbines around the perimeter of the data center at the time. Thermal images taken about a month later showed that at least 33 of them were operational, SELC said.\nAfter those images were taken, the Greater Memphis Chamber, a local economic development agency, said that xAI had removed some of the turbines. \n\u201cThe temporary natural gas turbines that were being used to power the Phase I GPUs prior to grid connection are now being demobilized and will be removed from the site over the next two months,\u201d the Memphis Chamber said. \u201cAbout half of the operating turbines will remain\u201d until a second substation completes the data center\u2019s connection to the grid, the organization added, and that once the substation was complete, the turbines would serve as backups.\nBut a flight on June 15 showed that at least 26 turbines remained, including three new ones that had been installed since the April flight. The total generating capacity was around 407 megawatts, just 14 megawatts shy of the previous amount.\n\u201cWith very few exceptions \u2014 none of which apply here \u2014 new sources of criteria and other air pollutants in Tennessee must obtain preconstruction approval in the form of an air permit as well as a permit to operate and emit pollutants,\u201d SELC said.\u00a0\nTopics\n\nSenior Reporter, Climate\n\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond\u2014founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

Unlike standard logins, passkeys use Face ID or Touch ID, a PIN, or a physical security authentication key to validate logins.\nPasskeys remove the need to rely on username and password combinations, which can be susceptible to phishing and other issues.\nFacebook says that passkeys will also start rolling out to Messenger in the coming months, and that users will be able to use the same passkey for both services. \nPasskeys can also be used to autofill payment information when making purchases using Meta Pay, Facebook says.\nTo set up a passkey, you\u2019ll navigate to the new \u201cpasskey\u201d option in Accounts Center within the Settings menu on Facebook. Once it\u2019s set up, you can start using your passkey to log in to Facebook on your phone. You\u2019ll still be able to use other authentication methods, such as your password, to access your account so that you can still access the social network when using a device that doesn\u2019t support passkeys.\nFacebook is one of many tech companies to introduce passkey support in the past year or so. Other big names that have done so include\u00a0Apple,\u00a0Microsoft,\u00a0Amazon,\u00a0Google,\u00a0PayPal,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0WhatsApp, X,\u00a0and\u00a0GitHub.\nTopics\n\nConsumer News Reporter\n\nAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

OpenAI could potentially use the patterns they\u2019ve found to better detect misalignment in production AI models, according to OpenAI interpretability researcher Dan Mossing.\n\u201cWe are hopeful that the tools we\u2019ve learned \u2014 like this ability to reduce a complicated phenomenon to a simple mathematical operation \u2014 will help us understand model generalization in other places as well,\u201d said Mossing in an interview with TechCrunch.\nAI researchers know how to improve AI models, but confusingly, they don\u2019t fully understand how AI models arrive at their answers \u2014 Anthropic\u2019s Chris Olah often remarks that AI models are grown more than they are built. OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic are investing more in interpretability research \u2014 a field that tries to crack open the black box of how AI models work \u2014 to address this issue.\nA recent study from Oxford AI research scientist\u00a0Owain Evans raised new questions about how AI models generalize. The research found that OpenAI\u2019s models could be fine-tuned on insecure code and would then display malicious behaviors across a variety of domains, such as trying to trick a user into sharing their password. The phenomenon is known as emergent misalignment, and Evans\u2019 study inspired OpenAI to explore this further.\nBut in the process of studying emergent misalignment, OpenAI says it stumbled into features inside AI models that seem to play a large role in controlling behavior. Mossing says these patterns are reminiscent of internal brain activity in humans, in which certain neurons correlate to moods or behaviors.\n\u201cWhen Dan and team first presented this in a research meeting, I was like, \u2018Wow, you guys found it,\u2019\u201d said Tejal Patwardhan, an OpenAI frontier evaluations researcher, in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cYou found like, an internal neural activation that shows these personas and that you can actually steer to make the model more aligned.\u201d\nSome features OpenAI found correlate to sarcasm in AI model responses, whereas other features correlate to more toxic responses in which an AI model acts as a cartoonish, evil villain. OpenAI\u2019s researchers say these features can change drastically during the fine-tuning process.\nNotably, OpenAI researchers said that when emergent misalignment occurred, it was possible to steer the model back toward good behavior by fine-tuning the model on just a few hundred examples of secure code.\nOpenAI\u2019s latest research builds on the previous work Anthropic has done on interpretability and alignment. In 2024, Anthropic released research that tried to map the inner workings of AI models, trying to pin down and label various features that were responsible for different concepts.\nCompanies like OpenAI and Anthropic are making the case that there\u2019s real value in understanding how AI models work, and not just making them better. However, there\u2019s a long way to go to fully understand modern AI models.\n\nTopics\n\nSenior AI Reporter\n\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond\u2014founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

New York\u2019s autonomous vehicle demonstration or testing permit requires a human driver to be able to take over; a $5 million insurance policy; and every test vehicle operator must be adequately trained in the safe operation of the test vehicle.\u00a0\nNew York law is especially prohibitive of autonomous vehicles. While securing a permit would be notable, Waymo is far from being able to launch commercial operations in the city \u2014 or even test without a human safety operator behind the wheel.\nStill, Waymo is pressing forward and said it\u2019s advocating for a change in state law that would allow for operating a vehicle with no human behind the wheel. The company is also trying to build goodwill in NYC and the state by working with several organizations such as MADD NY, YAI, National Federation of the Blind, and the Bronx Community College. \nWaymo told TechCrunch it has had positive conversations with lawmakers this year and hopes to keep making progress on regulatory changes. New York law states that any person operating a motor vehicle must have at least one hand (or prosthetic) on the steering mechanism at all times. Changing that wording will be key to Waymo eventually being able to deploy driverless vehicles.\nOther companies have tried to test in NYC before, including Mobileye and the now shuttered Cruise. But these efforts never materialized beyond a few demonstrations or pilots.\nOf course, New York City has other challenges beyond regulations. The city is chock-a-block with cars, trucks, delivery vans, bicycles, buses, and, importantly, people, all of whom are scuttling about. San Francisco, one of the markets that Waymo operates in today, is also a bustling city with many of the same challenges. NYC takes that complexity to a factor of 10.\nWaymo has eyed the massive market of NYC for years. In 2021, the company deployed its now retired Chrysler Pacifica minivans \u2014 the first self-driving vehicles in its testing fleet \u2014 to manually drive and map Manhattan. The company said at the time that each vehicle would have two people, one to drive and another in the passenger seat to help direct the activity of the driver, monitor the software on the vehicle in real time, evaluate the performance, and log comments.\nThose vehicles were never operated in autonomous mode even though they were all equipped with\u00a0fifth-generation Waymo Driver, which was its most current and advanced self-driving system at the time.\nOver the past four years, Waymo has scaled in numerous other places. The company provides more than 250,000 fully autonomous paid trips each week in several U.S. markets, including Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco.\n\nTopics\n\nTransportation Editor\n\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond\u2014founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

The company is currently testing vehicles in multiple U.S. cities and offering rides to early-access participants in Las Vegas. That early-rider program will expand to San Francisco later this year, and Zoox plans to launch paid public rides in Las Vegas this year, too. \nThe 220,000-square-foot factory is located in Hayward, California, near Zoox\u2019s Foster City headquarters. This is the company\u2019s second production facility in the Bay Area, adding to the assembly warehouse in nearby Fremont.\nZoox says the new factory will be used for engineering, software and hardware integration, assembly, storage, and testing. The Hayward production facility will assemble the custom-built Zoox robotaxis for multiple commercial markets, beginning with Las Vegas and then San Francisco. Zoox plans to roll out commercial robotaxi operations in Austin and Miami in the next few years.\nThe company says the facility\u2019s \u201cunique layout and building equipment\u201d will be able to adapt to different vehicle designs as its robotaxi lineup expands in the future. The facility will be operated by a mix of human workers and robots. Human workers will handle the bulk of the work, according to Zoox, which said robots will be used for specific tasks, such as applying adhesive for glass installation and transporting the robotaxi down the assembly line.\nCorrection: This story previously mischaracterized the current status of Zoox\u2019s early-rider program and commercial.
